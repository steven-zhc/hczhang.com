# Pattern matching
```haskell
lucky :: (Integral a) => a -> String
lucky 7 = "LUCKY NUMBER SEVEN!"
lucky x = "Sorry, you're out of luck!"

factorial :: (Integral a) => a -> a
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)

addVectors :: (Num a) => (a, a) -> (b, b) -> (a, a)
addVectors (x1, y1) (x2, y2) = (x1 + x2, y1 + y2)
```
```haskell
head :: [a] -> a
head [] = error "Cannot call head on an empty list"
head (x:_) = x
```
你若要绑定多个变量(用 _ 也是如此)，我们必须用括号将其括起
error 函数，它可以生成一个运行时错误

```haskell
length :: (Num b) => [a] -> b
length [] = 0
length (_:xs) = 1 + length xs
```

## as model
```haskell
capital :: String -> String  
capital "" = "Empty string, whoops!"  
capital all@(x:xs) = "The first letter of " ++ all ++ " is " ++ [x]
```
