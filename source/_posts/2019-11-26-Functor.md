# Functor

- Container with somewhere to store values(s)
- Some way of applying a function to values(s)
- Must return values(s) in same context

or a shorter explain:

> a functor is simply something that can be mapped over

# Monid

a monoid is a semigroup with an identity element.

# Semigroup

A semigroup is an algebraic structure with a binary operation that satisfies the associativity law.

In PureScript, the binary operation for a semigroup that satisfies the associative property is called append, whose infix operator is <>

# monoid

Identity: whenever we append one or more elements to it, we get back those elements

In PureScript, mempty (monoid empty) to reference the identity element of a monoid.
